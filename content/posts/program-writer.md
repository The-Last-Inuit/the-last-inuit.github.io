I majored in theoretical physics. It was a conscious decision, even though it 
pissed off my dad. He wanted me to major in computer science because he thought 
I'd end up as a professor. Why did he think that was bad? I dunno, it baffles 
me to this day.

Anyway, I usually use the title **Program Writer** instead of *Software Engineer* 
because, well:

* I didn't major in computer science.
* I didn't want to disrespect those who put in the effort to major in that 
  field.
* It just felt right.

People have asked me why **Program Writer** instead of, say, *Software Developer*. 
Until a few days ago, I didn't have a good answer. But now I think I do:

* Programming is solving explicit problems in a verifiable manner.
* Coding is expressing a programming solution in a formal language.
* Software engineering is building a product for the real world.

I've done all three, but I think programming suits me best—for a couple of 
reasons:

* I'm a physicist. We're trained to approach things in a peculiar way, 
  and our solutions are expected to be verifiable.
* Physicists enjoy solving problems, all kinds of problems, in many areas, 
  even the ones beyond our reach.
* Physicists live with uncertainty. Maybe not love it, but we're trained to 
  stay functional in that uncomfortable state.
* Our formal language is science.

So it kind of makes sense to call myself:

> A Program Writer.
