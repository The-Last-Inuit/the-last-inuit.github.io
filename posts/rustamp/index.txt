    rustamp
    Nov 10, 2025

    Do you remember the era of Winamp and Napster? I kind miss those days. So, today
    I want share rustamp, a small certainly-not-winamp mp3 player.
    It's going to be a toy will comeback from time to time to make it better. you can
    find the code here.
    This is how it looks right now

    It's buggy. I'm totally not convinced with the interface. I prefer text-based apps
    but the Halloy interface looks cool af. So, I use the same UI library, Iced.
    I'm thinking that perhaps i switch or have two versions:

    Iced UI
    RatatUI

    So, the next post we can work creating the new UI.
