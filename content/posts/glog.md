A few days ago, I started working on GLOG, a simple multiplayer shooter. I needed a project that:

* lets me use Elixir for the server
* is a game for our studio
* is fun rather than… professional 😅

```bash
glog/
  glog-cli/     # Lua, löve2D engine
  glog-server/  # Elixir
```

So far, I have [multiplayer working](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az2PiX58ZYwoqG3QXMyCKsuKDztKsS), no assets yet, and lots of functionality still pending but it runs smoothly.

And from that, a handy cheatsheet:
