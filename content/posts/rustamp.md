Do you remember the era of Winamp and Napster? I kind miss those days. So, today 
I want share *rustamp*, a small certainly-not-winamp mp3 player.
It's going to be a toy will comeback from time to time to make it better. you can 
find the code [here](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden/rad%3Az2ASiKcEkMnv5Cxru8E7P7Z9p6XzG).

This is how it looks right now

It's buggy. I'm totally not convinced with the interface. I prefer text-based apps 
but the [Halloy](https://halloy.chat/) interface looks cool *af*. So, I use the same UI library, [Iced](https://iced.rs/).

I'm thinking that perhaps i switch or have two versions:

* [Iced UI](https://iced.rs/)
* [RatatUI](https://ratatui.rs/)

So, the next post we can work creating the new UI.
