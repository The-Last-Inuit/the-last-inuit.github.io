We add supports local actor types Person, Application, and Service,
along with Note, Article, and Image objects and basic activity types
(Create, Update, Delete, Follow, Undo, Like, Announce).

ActivityPub endpoints

- POST /oauth/token
- GET /.well-known/webfinger
- GET /.well-known/nodeinfo
- GET /nodeinfo/2.0
- GET /users/:username
- GET /users/:username/outbox
- POST /users/:username/outbox
- POST /users/:username/media
- POST /users/:username/inbox
- POST /inbox
- GET /users/:username/followers
- GET /users/:username/following
- GET /objects/:id
- GET /activities/:id

C2S example

    curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/alice/outbox \
      -H "content-type: application/activity+json" \
      -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      -d '{"type":"Note","content":"Hello ActivityPub!","to":["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"]}'

Outbox image upload

    curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/alice/outbox \
      -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      -F "file=@/path/to/image.png" \
      -F "to=https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"

Media upload example

    curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/alice/media \
      -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      -F "file=@/path/to/image.png"

Use the returned url and mediaType when creating an Image object in the
outbox.

Collection pagination

Outbox, followers, and following collections return an OrderedCollection
with first and last links by default. Add ?page=1 (or ?page=true) to
receive an OrderedCollectionPage response.
