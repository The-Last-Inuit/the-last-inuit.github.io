This is a very opinionated blog about software engineering. None of the 
following is tru tru. What we do he'a is throw ideas 'round and see what breaks. 
It's messy, questionable, ilogical, and most likely illegal. Don't use these
ideas. 
Play with them.
Learn with them.
Steal what you find useful.
Move on, carnal.
