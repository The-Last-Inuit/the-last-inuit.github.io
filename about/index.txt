    Hello there. This is n0um3n4. I have this blog about software engineering.
    I created my first product back in 2009: a POS system that's still kicking
    ass with zero maintenance.
    I started in junior high. A friend taught me to code in BASIC. Around the
    same time, I was learning how to connect computers locally, for gaming, of
    course. I'd gotten internet about a year earlier, back when those dial-up
    tones were basically music. I got hooked on everything computer-related.
    Funny thing: I'm a curious person, but stopping at computers didn't feel
    like the right path, so I majored in theoretical physics. I never left my
    precious computers, though.
    During college, I made some money doing laptop maintenance and the usual
    stuff. A few years earlier, my father helped me get a gig repairing computers
    in an industrial complex, so I already kind of knew what I was doing when it
    came to fixing things. My father was, and still is, a tech junkie. I remember
    my favorite device was the oscilloscope. Majestic beast.
    One thing led to another, and in 2013 I decided to change careers and go back
    to coding, this time as a profession.
    Now I want to explore more. Fail more. Break more. And I want to document
    everything on this blog. I figure someone, or something, out there might
    benefit from it.
