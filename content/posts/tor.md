I've been self-studying hacking again. I wanted to add the ethical part, 
but honestly, I've stopped seeing the world in those terms.
No, I have no plans to be "evil". But you see, the world is run by a very 
small group of "people".
And technology is our best chance at freedom. It's almost diabolical that 
it has to be this way but hey, at least we have a chance.

While studying, I got the idea for a CLI to interact with the Tor protocol.
And why not? That could be a great project for this blog.
