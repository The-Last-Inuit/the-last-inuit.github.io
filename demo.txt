"Deeds belong to their hour, and no other. As for idle tales, they bear

Currently working as a Product Engineer @ Yolo Group | Elixir

I make my living as a software developer with experience in Elixir, Ruby,
PHP, and JavaScript. I've worked across different stacks, mostly building
backend systems and APIs, but I’m comfortable doing full-stack work when
needed.

I’ve contributed to projects in marketplaces, real estate, healthcare,
Web3, finance, and e-commerce. Most recently, I’ve been focused on Elixir
and Phoenix LiveView, and I really enjoy the simplicity and clarity the
language brings. I’ve also worked with Docker, PostgreSQL, and various
frontend frameworks like Svelte and AlpineJS.

I’ve made mistakes, missed deadlines, and learned a lot from them.
I take responsibility and try to get better with every project.

PS: I am a theoretical physicist. I deliberately abandoned my PhD and left
academia as an act of protest.

VALUES, PRINCIPLES AND BELIEFS
------------------------------------------------------------

The human being I'm trying to be

  - Preserve, not to destroy. Wield power to do good.
  - Real strength lies in domestication of one's emotions not in pretending
    they don't exist.
  - Educate yourself.
  - Courage and humility

My values

  - Honor others: No matter what degree, title or lack of it, everyone has
    something to offer. It takes a village to raise a child. We all have a
    role to fulfill.
  - Empower others: Things are hard and complex. We all are doomed to make
    mistakes. Making room for mistakes allow us to grow.
  - Privilege people: Existence is pain and this system we have created only
    make things harder. Remember we are flying away on a gigant rock. Don't
    get dragged away by irrelevant things like profit, titles, ego, etc.
  - Serve with humility: We all have room for improvement, recognize it.
    Listen to others' feedback and be open to criticism.

Things I believe

  - Reversed Trust: Usually we earn respect and trust by working on it. In
    my case, I believe in trusting and respecting others since the beginning
    100%. They work on keeping that. In my experience, people start showing
    you who they real are and therefore the trust and respect may decrease.
    This is not great since I've been abused and hurt. But I believe in a
    human's good heart. Granted, maybe naive but that's who I am.
  - How can I help? I think the only way to be the best leader is by being
    of service to others.
  - I will hold your heart more tenderly than my own. I will. For some
    reason I think I can take all the pain in the Cosmos.
  - The less forgivable the act, the more must be forgiven. The less loveable
    the person is, the more you must find the means to love them. I have
    learnt that the hard way but I believe I must follow such principle.
  - I think everyone has something to offer and they are always open to do
    that. The problem is there are so many things affecting us that we tend
    to be mean to each other, however, this means I believe humans have a
    good heart.
  - Any one has the capacity to become awesome at something. The reasons why
    people look for expertise, in the end I believe, has nothing to do with
    the actual matter. I'd rather collaborate with someone up for a challange
    than with some expert on the matter.
  - We need one another. Anyone can do things on its own... Perhaps not
    everything. However, I believe doing things together makes the experience
    more fun.
  - You are going to fail. And so will I. That's the way it is and I'm fine
    with the logic behind. Do fail. By all means, do it.
  - I'm an open book. I trust you by default. And if you decide to break that
    trust, that's alright. You will save me some time. I'm all about creating
    long lasting friendships and time is of the essence.
  - There are social conventions, social cues and sugar coding. I don't
    understand any of them. Just be straight with me. I won't get offended.
    Otherwise, there will be misunderstanding. I guarantee that.
