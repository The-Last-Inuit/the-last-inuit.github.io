<p><strong>Design Notes on the Varenna Demo</strong></p>
<p>I have been building a small design system called Varenna that lives in three
places: CSS, a ratatui TUI, and an iced GUI. The demo exists to answer a simple
question: can one visual grammar survive across these very different surfaces
without feeling like a forced port? The answer is "mostly yes," and the demo
is where I pressure test that.</p>
<p>This post is a casual walkthrough of the demo and the design decisions behind
it. It is not a release announcement. It is just a tour of the parts that
matter to me as I iterate.</p>
<p><strong>What the demo shows</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/var%C3%ABnna-ratatui.png" alt="varënna" /></p>
<p>The ratatui demo is a split layout: a left panel with a queue table and a right
panel with details. It is intentionally dense so I can test readable spacing,
hover states, and keyboard focus at the same time. There are also overlays for
a command palette and a dialog, plus a toast stack so I can validate transient
messaging.</p>
<p><img src="/img/var%C3%ABnna-css.png" alt="varënna" /></p>
<p>The CSS demo mirrors the same components: panels, badges, tabs, meters, buttons,
inputs, and a dialog. I keep the HTML minimal because the point is the component
styling, not the DOM structure.</p>
<p><strong>Visual grammar: tokens first</strong></p>
<p>The design system is token driven. I treat spacing, line weight, and accent
color as the "voice" of the UI. The tokens are not just for colors. They also
encode details like:</p>
<ul>
<li>padding size (used for both layout and inner frame calculations)</li>
<li>border weight and dotted line style</li>
<li>accent glow intensity (used on hover)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping these in a single place makes it possible to tune the overall feel
without hunting through component code. When I push the accent brightness
up, everything that wants to feel "active" follows.</p>
<p><strong>Panels and frames</strong></p>
<p>The core component is the framed panel. The frame is always the same language:
clipped corners, dotted borders, optional ticks, and a bold title. The frame is
drawn first, then the inner content is rendered into a padded inner rect. This
matters in a TUI because any off by one errors will panic or leave artifacts.</p>
<p>The frame does two jobs:</p>
<ol>
<li>It isolates content so dense layouts are still readable.</li>
<li>It communicates the "device" vibe without needing background art.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also use the frame in small components like badges and meters. That keeps
the system consistent, even when the component itself is only 5 lines tall.</p>
<p><strong>The ratatui demo: interaction and state</strong></p>
<p>The demo is designed around 4 focus areas: table, tabs, button, and form.
Mouse hover is supported, but the keyboard is the default. The focus indicator
in the top bar is the fastest way to spot state bugs when I am debugging.</p>
<p>Important interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrow keys move within the table and form.</li>
<li>Tab switching is both mouse and keyboard friendly.</li>
<li>Ctrl+K opens a command palette and dims the background.</li>
<li>D opens a confirmation dialog.</li>
<li>Q quits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overlays matter because they are a state stack, not just a widget.
They force me to manage focus, block input to the base UI, and handle clicks
outside the modal. The dimming layer is a tiny detail, but it makes the demo
feel like a system instead of a bunch of rectangles.</p>
<p><strong>The design payoff</strong></p>
<p>The thing I like most is the way the system feels "electrical" without being
noisy. The glow is restrained, the frame does the heavy lifting, and the
typography stays small and tight. The goal is that you can look at a screen
full of this UI and still scan for the important stuff quickly.</p>
<p>The demo also keeps me honest about density. A terminal window does not have
infinite space, so the layout has to work at smaller sizes. If a component
cannot collapse gracefully, it does not belong in the system.</p>
